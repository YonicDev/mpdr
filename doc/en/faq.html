		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2>Q: Can I use this with the Metroid Prime Item Radomizer?</h2>
		<p>A: Yes, this is called stacking. For more information, check <a href="stacking.html">its relevant</a> article.</p>
		<h2>Q: Can I use the same save files from the Item Randomizer?</h2>
		<p>A: Yes, although this might be subject to change in the future.</p>
		<h2>Q: Are all configurations clearable?</h2>
		<p>A: In theory, yes, as long as the Blue door weights are set high enough or originally blue doors are excluded from being randomized.</p>
		<h2>Q: Why are some doors always excluded from being randomized?</h2>
		<p>A: Some doors aren't doors that you have to shoot at to open (Morph Ball doors and the huge Core Reactor doors).
		The rest are doors placed on the floor or the ceiling, which aren't currently supported for randomization.</p>
		<h2>Q: Can I play this on my GameCube / Wii?</h2>
		<p>A: It should be possible with Riivolution, although it has not been tested yet.</p>
