		<h1>Configuring MPDR</h1>
			<p>You can configure how MPDR randomizes the doors by modifying the following properties.</p>
			<h2>Basic properties</h2>
				<p>These properties can be modified from the main window.</p>
				<h3>Seed</h3>
					<p>The seed is a number from 0 to 4294967295 (that's 2<sup>32</sup>-1) that the randomizer uses to determine which type any given door will be.</p>
					<p>You can type it yourself, have it generated randomly with the Generate button, or convert the current time you're at into a seed number with the Use time button.</p>
					<p>By default, it uses the time at which you've opened the program as seed.</p>
				<h3>Door weights</h3>
			        <p>Door weights modify how frequent a door of a certain type is in one of the five major areas of Tallon IV
						(Tallon Overworld, Chozo Ruins, Magmoor Caverns, Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines).</p>
				    <p>Each are controlled with a slider ranging from 0 to 100, which represent the <b>percentage of occurrence</b> for a certain type of door. For example, an area with 50% in blue and 50% in purple
					will only contain blue and purple doors, and each will have the same chance of being blue or purple.</p>
					<p>Because they are percentages, <b>the sum of all weights on each area must equal exactly 100.</b></p>
				<h2>Advanced properties</h2>
				<p>These properties can be controlled from the windows that pop up from the buttons in the Advanced settings section of the main window.</p>
				<h3>Excluded doors</h3>
					<center><img src="./2-interface-4.png"/></center>
					<p>You can choose which doors shall not be randomized. All excluded doors will have the same color as they would in the original game.</p>
					<p>By default, all doors that MPDR cannot randomize are excluded.</p>
					<div class="ambox">Because they can't be randomized, their exclusion cannot be undone.</div>
					<p>For more information, check the <a href="./exclusion.html">Excluding doors</a> article.</p>
			    <h3>Initial pickups</h3>
					<center><img class="responsive" style="max-width:531px" src="./2-interface-2.png"/></center>
					<p>You can choose which upgrades and expansions you'll start with upon landing on Tallon Overworld.</p>
					<div class="ambox"><b>NOTE:</b> The Power Suit is always enabled, and the Phazon Beam is always enabled if the Phazon Suit is enabled.</div>
					<p>Missiles are expressed in total ammount of missiles, and the arrow buttons add or subtract 5 to that amount.</p>
					<p>The maximum of each of the expansions is the same as the original game (250 missiles, 14 energy tanks and 8 power bombs).</p>
				<h3>Patch settings</h3>
					<p>These settings are for miscellaneous patches that are meant for difficulty settings and shortcuts for speedrunners.</p>
					<center><img class="responsive" style="max-width:654px" src="./2-interface-3.png"/></center>
					<h4>Skipping</h4>
						<p>These settings are for skipping certain elements and sections of the game.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Skip item collected messages:</b> The game will not pause to show a message when collecting an upgrade or expansion, and
							instead shows a small message at the top of the visor.</li>
							<li><b>Skip Frigate:</b> Skip the Pirate Frigate, with the game starting on the landing sequence to Tallon Overworld.</li>
							<li><b>Skip Impact Crater:</b> The warp to the Impact Crater is replaced to a warp to the end scene.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>By default, only the Pirate Frigate is skipped.</p>
					<h4>Difficulty</h4>
						<p>These settings are for adjusting the difficulty of the game.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Heat damage protection:</b> You can choose whether every suit except the Power Suit gives protection to Magmoor Caverns' extreme heat, or
								only the Varia Suit does.</li>
							<li><b>Damage reduction:</b> If you select "Always use the most powerful", you use the resistance given by the strongest suit you've collected, regardless of what suits you have.
							"Stack with suits" computes the total resistance given by each individual suit.</li>
							<li><b>Power bomb lock-picking:</b> If you enable this option, you can use Power Bombs to open a door of any color.</li>
							<li><b>Super Metroid doors:</b> (Not implemented yet) Any non-blue door will turn blue upon opening.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>By default it uses the same settings as the original game: Only the Varia Suit grants protection for extreme heat and the strongest suit's protection is always used.</p>
					<h4>Door modifications</h4>
					<div class="ambox warning"><b>WARNING:</b> These patches are experimental and might cause MPDR or a randomized game to crash.</div>
					<p>These settings can enable randomizing certain doors.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Enable one-way door randomization:</b> Transforms the one-way door that connects the Vault with the Main Plaza in Chozo Ruins, enabling its randomization.</li>
						<li><b>Randomize vertical doors:</b> (Not implemented yet) Enables randomization for doors placed on the ground and the ceiling.
					</ul>
					<h4>Miscellaneous patches</h4>
					<p>These patches are merely aesthetical.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Patch map:</b> Patch the door icons in the world map so that they match their actual color. By default, it is enabled.
						<li><b>Fix Flaaghra music files:</b> In the 0-00 version, the Flaaghra music uses a shortened version. By using a Metroid Prime Trilogy disc file, MPDR will copy the full theme for Flaaghra so that it can be heard in that version.</li>
						<li><b>Keep Attract Mode:</b> If active, the videos that show on the title screen after a while will not be erased.</li>
					</ul>
