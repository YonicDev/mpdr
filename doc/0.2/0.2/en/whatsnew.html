		<h1>What's new in MPDR v0.2</h1>
		<p>These are the new features for MPDR version 0.2.</p>
		<p>For features that come in minor updates of this version, check the corresponding subversions' features in the documentation.</p>
		<h2>Door Exclusion</h2>
            <center><img src="0-whatsnew-1.png"></center>
            <p>Doors can now be excluded from being randomized, using the <a href="exclusion.html">Door Excluder tool</a>
            which can enable or disable randomizing for specific doors in each of the 5 main areas. When excluded, the doors will have the same type as in the original game.</p>
            <div class="ambox warning">Currently, this tool is experimental and needs proper testing to check its functionality.</div>
        <h2>MPDR Preset compatibility</h2>
            <p>MPDR v0.2 uses version 3 of presets, but retains compatibility with version 2. From this version it is also compatible with MPDR Preset version 1. </p>
            <p>To convert an existing preset to the latest version, open it in MPDR and save it with the same name.</p>
        <h2>Revamped documentation</h2>
            <center><img src="0-whatsnew-2.png"></center>
            <p>From this version, MPDR uses Chromium in all platforms to display the documentation instead of the dated Qt Assistant, allowing it to be fully customized and more intuitive for the user.</p>
            <p>It also has multi-language support, and the ability to check the documentation for older versions of the documentation, if available.</p>
