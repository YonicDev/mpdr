		<h1>Requirements</h1>
		<p>To use MPDR, you need a valid NTSC v1.00 or v1.02 version of Metroid Prime disc image. The process of obtaining one is not covered, but this section covers how to distinguish between versions.</p>
		<h2>Finding the version from disc</h2>

		<p>You need to find the text located in the highlighted area in the image above on your disc. It can come out in different forms:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li><b>DOL-GM8E:</b> Refers to the NTSC (American) release of the game. Only those with <b>0-00</b> (first release) and <b>0-02</b> (Player's Choice) at the end are compatible.</li>
		    <li><b>DOL-GM8J:</b> Refers to the JAP (Japanese) release of the game. This version is not compatible with MPDR.</li>
		    <li><b>DOL-GM8P:</b> Refers to the PAL (European) release of the game. This version is not compatible with MPDR.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Finding the version from Dolphin</h2>

		<p><i>Properties window of a Metroid Prime Game in Dolphin.</i></p></center>
		<p>If you already have a disc image of Metroid Prime (hopefully by creating one yourself) you can use Dolphin to identify the version.</p>
		<p>While in Dolphin, right-click on the Metroid Prime game entry and select "Properties". Then, select the Info tab.</p>
		<p>The Game ID property is exactly the same as the text that you would find at the back of the disc, save for the number at the end which can be ignored.<br/>
		As for the version, the Revision field correlates directly to the numbers at the end of the text stated above, so 0 is 0-00 and 2 is 0-02.</p>

		<h2>Verifying the disc file</h2>
		<p>To verify if you're holding a disc image of the correct version of Metroid Prime, performing an MD5 checksum on the disc is recommended. It also serves as a way to check in case the file is infected.</p>
		<p>It can easily be checked in Dolphin by pressing the "Compute" button while looking at the properties of the Metroid Prime file.</p>
		<p>Here is a list of checksums of legitimate and compatible Metroid Prime disc images:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li><b>0-00 version:</b> <span class="mono">eeacd0ced8e2bae491eca14f141a4b7c</span></li>
		    <li><b>0-02 version:</b> <span class="mono">fdfc41b8414dd7d24834c800f567c0f8</span></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Warning!</h2>
		<p>Do not use an already modified ISO! (via MPDR or Prime Item Randomizer) Only a disc image file clean of patches will work.</p>
