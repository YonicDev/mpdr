		<h1>Coming soon in MPDR</h1>
		<p>This is a list of the planned features for the upcoming versions. (It also serves as a TODO for the developers!)</p>

		<h2>Platform support</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Support for mac OS </b> from Sierra (10.12) onward.</li>
			<li><b>Appimage for Linux</b>, so that MPDR can be easily downloaded without building it from source.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Randomizer</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Map patches:</b> So that the doors' colors show up properly in the map.</li>
			<li><b>Power Bomb lockpicking:</b> In a pinch, use a Power Bomb to open a door of any color.</li>
			<li><b>Easy Doors:</b> When a non-blue door is opened, it will turn to blue permanently.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>MPDR</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Full multi-language support:</b> Allows switching between languages without changing the system languages.</li>
			<li><b>Door Excluder 2.0:</b> Instead of just excluding doors from being randomized, also allow to force them being a different color.</li>
