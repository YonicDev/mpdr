		<h1>Excluding doors</h1>
		<center><img src="4-doorexcluder-0.png"/></center>
		<p>The Door Excluder tool helps selecting which doors to exclude from randomization. It shows a 2D map of each of the five main regions of Tallon IV
		for you to check out. <br/>You can move around by dragging around the map view or using the sliders to the sides, and you may switch between areas by clicking the tab with the corresponding area name.</p>
		<p>The doors appear either <b style="color:#03b813">green</b> (randomized) or <b style="color:#c31717">dark red</b> (excluded), and the one you have currently selected will show a <span style="border:1px blue solid;padding:0 0.3em;">blue border</span>.
		The checkbox allows you to change the state of the door you have currently selected. Doors can be selected by clicking on their icons in the map.</p>
		<h2>Door pairs</h2>
		<p>Every "door" in Metroid Prime is actually a pair of two "door objects", each one belongs to one of the two connecting rooms.
		MPDR distinguishes between both of these doors, so it's important to know which side of each pair you're editing at all times.
		The tool identifies each door by showing the room in which the selected door belongs to, and the number ID of that door within that room.</p>
		<p>Most door pairs are placed next to each other in the map, but in some cases the rooms have been separated from the main map, and so the relevant pairs of doors
		will be separated (see the door leading to the Warrior Shrine in the figure above for an example of this).</p>
		<h2>Door layout</h2>
		<p>Because the maps are 2D viewed from above, it's hard to convey the height of the doors. To temporarily solve this issue, the door excluder tool
		is using the following convention for heights:</p>
		<center><img src="../common/4-doorexcluder-1.png"/> <img src="../common/4-doorexcluder-2.png"/></center>
		<ul>
			<li>For doors placed on the ceiling or the floor, the one on the floor is placed to the left, and the one on the ceiling is placed to the right.</li>
			<li>For two pairs of doors placed just above or below each other, the top-most pair is placed to the left or slightly higher, depending on the orientation.
			The lower-most pair is placed to the right or slightly lower, also depending on the orientation.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="ambox">These do not apply when the pairs have been separated, like in the level elevators in the Phazon Mines, in which case the top-most pair is located in the upper level,
		where it would normally belong within the elevator map room, and the bottom-most pair are placed in the lower level, where the elevator map room would be if it was connected to that area.

		<h2>Unrandomizable doors</h2>
		<p>Some doors, either because of limitations of MPDR or not being doors that can be shot at to open, cannot be randomized. These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All doors placed on the floor or ceiling of a room.</li>
			<li><i>All small Morph Ball doors.</i></li>
			<li><i>All the reactor doors within the Crashed Frigate.</i></li>
			<li>All the ventilation system doors within the Crashed Frigate.</li>
			<li><i>The one-way door that connects the Main Plaza with the Plaza Access in Chozo Ruins.</i></li>
			<li>The door that connects the West Tower to the Control Tower in Phendrana Drifts.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="ambox warning"><b>NOTE:</b> The latter door hasn't been confirmed if it can be randomized, so it currently can be marked as randomizable, but this may be subject to change
		in later versions.</div>
		<p>The doors in <i>italics</i> don't require to be shot to open, and thus will always be excluded from randomization across all versions of MPDR.</p>
