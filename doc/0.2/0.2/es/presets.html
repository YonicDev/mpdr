		<p>You can save and load pre-set configurations (presets) for your own convenience.</p>
		<p>To do so, use the <b>File</b> menu at the top of the main window of MPDR.</p>
		<p>MPDR's profile is designed to retain backwards compatibility with profiles from older versions of MPDR,
		except for currently the first version of MPDR (Prototype 1).<br/>To convert an older version profile to the latest,
	    simply open it in MPDR and save it again.</p>
