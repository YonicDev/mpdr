		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2>Q: Can I use this with the Metroid Prime Item Radomizer?</h2>
		<p>A: No, because both the Item Randomizer and MPDR require a clean iso to patch.</p>
		<h2>Q: But can I use the save files from the Item Randomizer?</h2>
		<p>A: Yes, although this might be subject to change in the future.</p>
		<h2>Q: Are all configurations clearable?</h2>
		<p>A: In theory, yes, as long as the Blue door weights are set high enough.</p>
		<h2>Q: Can I play this on my GameCube / Wii?</h2>
		<p>A: It should be possible with Riivolution, although it has not been tested yet.</p>
